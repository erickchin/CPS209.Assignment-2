# CPS209: Assignment 2
Second assignment done in the course CPS209 - Computer Science II 

This assignment is a wrap up of the core concepts of object orientated design and displayed through Java.
The concept of this game is to match your own object onto the objects randomly placed onto the Jframe. Patterns are randomly generated and timed to have its pattern disappear. It incorporates inheritance, basic GUI and event handling to interact with the user's input.

Assignment 2 is a interactive data structure simulator. It displays a user interface of how nodes, stacks and queues work by using a simple truck example. The cart attachment shows how nodes would work, cart that gets the box first is the queue integrated in and the box holder shows stack data structure.
